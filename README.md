The panel takes 12v power from Eurorack socket and converts to 9v for the Korg Volca. 
Audio brought to Eurorack levels through a separate audio out. 
The whole panel is then secured to the Korg Volca through 4 mounting legs  (STL files are provided for 3d printing )
Alternatively you can find the model for the legs on on Thinyverse
